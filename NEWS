NEWS for Rwave package
======================

2.8-1  2011-12-16
	o   Upgrade of Rwave and related wavelet transform functions
		Fixed bug in JSEGY.seis related to samprate
2.8-2	2011-12-23
	o  New PLOT argument {-1, 0, 1} on JGET.seis, JSAC.seis, JSEGY.seis

3.0-0	2012-02-29
	o Major changes in pick-list structure:
		added routines for manipulation WPX lists for picking:
		addWPX  catWPX  checkWPX  cleanWPX  deleteWPX  
		NEWPLOT.WPX  repairWPX  replaceWPX  saveWPX  selWPX  setWPX
	o Added new function many.time1D that vectorized the travel.time1D function
		Fixed sel in CHOP.SEISN according to Jake Anderson suggestion
		Fixed setstas so they do not read beyond end of data for each line
			This allows comments in station file
		minor changes to swig 
		
3.0-1	2012-03-06
	o Major changes: 
		PLOT.SEISN and swig:  new parameter xtickfactor allows user to change the x-axis units
		JSAC.seis: added in the b - offset for SAC header information
			In SAC  a beginning offset in seconds must be added to the time

3.0-5	2012-04-27
	o Major changes: 
		ADDED rseis2sac to write out a set of SAC format files for exchange.
3.0-8   2012-07-16
	o Minor changes: 
	Fixed bug in Ray.time1D.R - now the program takes velocity and converts internally to slowness

3.1-2	2013-04-09
	o Minor changes: 
	Earlier Jake called attention to a bug in JSEGY.seis, dealing with sample rate.
	This was fixed wrongly and now the code checks samprate and deltaSample to extract the sample rate

3.1-3   2013-05-20
	o Minor changes:	
	Fixed CHOP.SEISN
	fixed memory leak in GETARAIC man example

3.2-0   2013-06-03
	o Minor changes: 
       Changed Documentation to conform with length standards
       Fixed index bug in hilbert transform
       JSEGY.seis: Iendian can be a vector now when files have different byte order
       
       
3.2-5  Thu Oct 31 09:58:13 EDT 2013
       o Minor changes: 
       Fix bug in makeDB with dirs 
       

3.3-1  Sun Dec 15 12:28:47 EST 2013
       o Minor changes: 
       Fix bug in plt.MTM0 with sample rates(Jake A.)
       Added Adjust parameter in evolfft  to allow for user control of parameters

3.4-1  Sun Jul 13 12:54:04 EDT 2014
       o Minor changes: 
       Fixed bug in CHOP.SEISN
       vectorized input parameters in FmakeDB
       NEW I/O functions write1segy, write1sac, read1sac, read1segy, sac2rseis, segy2rseis
       	       		 rseis2segy, rseis2sac

3.4-4   Tue Apr 14 12:11:05 EDT 2015
	o Minor changes: 
	Fixed bugs in write1segy, getphaselag2, INSTresponse

4.1-2	Tue Oct 18 23:05:25 EDT 2022
	o Major changes:
	 Input/output many files now in RDS format
	 fixed C-code to be compliant with CRAN
